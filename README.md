Refugees United IVR Platform
======================

A web based platform which integrates the Refugees United API and Twilio.

Users can:

* Send an SMS to a phone number and have the platform call them back (save money...?)

* Authenticate using a PIN (currently setup online through my IVR Platform website - but this would be integrated into the RefUnited platform)

* Hear a count of unread messages

* Using text-to-speech have any messages played back to them

* Send a voice message to a "favourite"

* Listen to voice messages received and have the option to delete message / reply to message
